## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & How I Solved Them

### 1. **Partial Transaction Rollback**

* Solved by using `DB::transaction()` to wrap all operations. On any failure, nothing is persisted.

### 2. **Race Conditions**

* Used `lockForUpdate()` to lock rows and prevent multiple users from buying the last units at the same time.

### 3. **Flexible Pricing Rules**

* Modularized pricing logic into a service class for reusability and maintainability.
